I'm Drew. I'm bootstrapping products as a solo-founder (currently [plzdm.me](https://plzdm.me)). At the moment I'm building with:

- Amplify
- Next.js 
- Supabase
- Tailwind
- Vercel

I write longer form essays at [drew.tech](https://drew.tech/) and a weekly newsletter for bootstrappers at [newsletter.drew.tech](https://newsletter.drew.tech).

Let's connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DBredvick) or you can [email](mailto:drewb@hey.com) me.
