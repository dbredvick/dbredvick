My name is Drew â€“ I'm building SaaS for GTM teams while growing sales engineering at â–²[Vercel](https://drew.tech/posts/vercel).

I write about web dev, startups, and Next.js [here](https://drew.tech/newsletter).

### Now

I'm building tools for go-to-market teams, especially at DevTool companies like Vercel. As a developer turned sales engineer, I love using code to fix the painful parts of selling. 

Iâ€™m building [SoloSync](https://solosync.io) SoloSync, which makes keeping Salesforce and Notion in sync so that teams can stay on the same page while reducing your Salesforce bill.

I discovered many of these problems working enterprise sales deals at Vercel. 

_btw â€”Â you should probably [learn sales](https://drew.tech/posts/learning-sales-as-an-engineer)._

### Uses
At the moment I'm building with:

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS & UI
- NextAuth
- Prisma
- Planetscale
