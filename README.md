My name is Drew – I'm making the web faster at ▲[Vercel](https://drew.tech/posts/vercel) while [bootstrapping SaaS](https://drew.tech/posts/bootstrap-1000) on the side.

I'm currently building [TrySlater.com](https://tryslater.com), the best way to create cron jobs in Next.js.

I write about web dev, startups, and Next.js. See my back catalog of posts [here](https://drew.tech/posts).
