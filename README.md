I'm Drew. I build products in areas I'm interested in and write about it (currently building [fitvitals.dev](https://fitvitals.dev), a free tool to check your Core Web Vital health). 

I write longer form essays at [drew.tech](https://drew.tech/) and a weekly newsletter at [drew.tech/newsletter](https://drew.tech/newsletter).

Let's connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DBredvick) or you can [email](mailto:drewb@hey.com) me.
