Hey, my name is Drew â€“ I'm a Software Engineer at â–²Vercel. I'm a full stack JavaScript developer and have worked in e-commerce at the intersection of marketing and engineering most of my career.

I've shipped tons of products (a few successes, a few more failures) and write about how I use React & Next.js to build side projects & startups.

I write a weekly-ish newsletter and longer form posts occasionally.

Sign up here if you want emails from me about building real products with Next.js.
Let's connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DBredvick) or you can [email](mailto:drewb@hey.com) me.

### Uses
At the moment I'm building with:

- React
- Next.js
- Supabase
- Tailwind
- Vercel

and here are some articles about why I use them:
