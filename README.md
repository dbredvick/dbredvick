Iâ€™m Drew Bredvick, leading GTM Engineering at Vercel. I write playbooks from the field, notes from side projects, and reflections on the craft of shipping and selling software [here](https://drew.tech/).

### Now

I joined Vercel's go-to-market team four years ago and am building a team to build the future of GTM with AI.

_btw â€”Â you should probably [learn sales](https://drew.tech/posts/learning-sales-as-an-engineer)._

### Uses
At the moment I'm building with:

- Next.js + AI SDK
- Tailwind & Shadcn
- Clerk
- Drizzle
- Planetscale

and here are some articles about tech:

- [Why Next.js?](https://drew.tech/posts/why-nextjs)
