I'm Drew. I work in tech and bootstrap products on the side to earn my financial freedom. I'm interested in tech that enables solo-founders. Right now that includes:

- Amplify
- Next.js 
- Supabase
- Tailwind
- Vercel

I write about everything I learn at [drew.tech](https://drew.tech/).

I've written a lot about:

- [Next.js tips and tricks](https://drew.tech/topics/nextjs)
- [Intro to Core Web Vitals](https://drew.tech/topics/core-web-vitals)
- [Building side projects as a solo founder](https://drew.tech/topics/side-projects)
