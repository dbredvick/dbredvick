Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew â€“ I'm a Software Engineer at â–²Vercel.

I've shipped tons of products and write about how I use React & Next.js to build side projects & startups.

I write a weekly-ish newsletter containing three tips for your side projects, two web dev articles, and one project update from me.

[Sign up here](https://newsletter.drew.tech) if you want emails from me about building real products with Next.js.

Let's connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DBredvick) or you can [email](mailto:hey@drew.tech) me.

### Uses
