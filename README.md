My name is Drew â€“ I'm building SaaS for GTM teams while growing sales engineering at â–²[Vercel](https://drew.tech/posts/vercel).

I write about web dev, startups, and Next.js [here](https://drew.tech/).

### Now

I'm building tools for go-to-market teams, especially at DevTool companies like Vercel. As a developer turned sales engineer, I love using code to fix the painful parts of selling. 

Iâ€™m building [SoloSync](https://gptreport.com) GPT Report, the best way to stay stay on top of your brand's appearance in ChatGPT and other LLMs.

_btw â€”Â you should probably [learn sales](https://drew.tech/posts/learning-sales-as-an-engineer)._

At the moment I'm building with:

- Next.js
- Tailwind & Shadcn
- Clerk
- Drizzle
- Planetscale
